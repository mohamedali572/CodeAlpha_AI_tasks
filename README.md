# CodeAlpha_AI_tasks
This repository contains 3 Artificial Intelligence Tasks  to CodeAlpha internship

##TASK 1

# CodeAlpha – Language Translation Tool

## Overviwe
This project is a **Language Translation Tool** that allows users to input text, select the source and target languages, and translate it instantly. The application is built using **Python** and provides a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for ease of use.

---

## Features
- Translate text between multiple languages.
- Simple and user-friendly GUI.
- Uses popular translation APIs (Google Translate / Microsoft Translator).
- Clear display of translated text.
- Lightweight and easy to run.

##TASK 2

# CodeAlpha – Music Generation with AI

## Overview
This project demonstrates **AI-based Music Generation** using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks.  
It trains a neural network on classical MIDI datasets and generates new musical compositions in MIDI format.  
The project also provides a way to convert MIDI files to audio using **FluidSynth** and soundfonts.

---

## Features
- Train AI to compose classical-style music.
- Generate MIDI files with original melodies.
- Convert generated MIDI to playable audio.
- Use pre-trained LSTM models or train from scratch.
- Supports custom MIDI datasets.

---

## Dataset
We used the **Classical Music MIDI Dataset** available on Kaggle:  
[Classical Music MIDI Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/classical-music-midi)

Download and extract the dataset into the `dataset/` folder before training.

## Additional Resources
- **FluidR3 GM SoundFont** (for MIDI playback):  
[Download FluidR3_GM.sf2](https://member.keymusician.com/Member/FluidR3_GM/index.html)

- **FluidSynth for Windows (64-bit)**:  
[Download FluidSynth 2.4.7](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/releases/download/v2.4.7/fluidsynth-2.4.7-win10-x64.zip)
